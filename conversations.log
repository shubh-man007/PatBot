Antacids (quick relief, e.g., Tums, Maalox), H2 Blockers (longer relief, e.g., Pepcid AC/famotidine, Tagamet HB/cimetidine), and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) (strongest acid reduction, e.g., Omeprazole, Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole) for conditions like heartburn, GERD, and ulcers, with OTC options like Prilosec OTC, Nexium 24HR, and prescription-strength versions available. They work by neutralizing acid (antacids) or blocking its production (H2 blockers, PPIs) to allow healing.

2025-12-17 02:00:07,245 - INFO - Patient patient_20251217_015933_166728 - Patient says: Yeah, of course. So I've been getting these really severe headaches that come on pretty suddenly. They're pretty debilitating when they hit. On top of that, I've been dealing with nausea, which makes it even harder to get through the day. It's been affecting my work and just my quality of life in general. Do you have any idea what might be causing this?

As for medications, I've tried over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but they don't seem to help much. The nausea has been tough to manage too—I've tried some basic remedies but nothing really takes care of both issues at once. I'm hoping you might be able to run some tests or suggest something that could actually help.

And loud noises or sudden sounds seem to trigger or intensify the headaches too. It's gotten to the point where I find myself wanting to be in a dark, quiet room when these episodes hit. It's pretty limiting, honestly.
